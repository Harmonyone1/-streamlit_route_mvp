## Microsoft Graph API (Outlook Calendar) Setup

### Prerequisites

   - **Directory (tenant) ID** - Save this
   - These will be your `client_id` and `tenant_id`

### Step 2: Create Client Secret

1. Go to "Certificates & secrets"
2. Click "New client secret"
3. **Description:** Route Dispatcher
4. **Expires:** Choose duration (24 months recommended)
5. Click "Add"
6. **Copy the VALUE immediately** - This is your `client_secret`
   - Note: The value is only shown once!

### Step 3: Grant API Permissions

1. Go to "API permissions"
2. Click "Add a permission"
3. Choose "Microsoft Graph"
4. Select "Application permissions" (NOT Delegated)

## Security Considerations

### Email Security

- Use minimum required permissions
- Monitor access logs
- Revoke unused app registrations

### Data Privacy

- Don't expose customer data unnecessarily

- Log access appropriately
- Comply with privacy regulations

## Troubleshooting

### Email Not Sending

**Check:**
- SMTP credentials correct
- Port not blocked by firewall
- Email provider allows SMTP
- Technician email addresses valid
- Check spam/junk folders

**Gmail Specific:**
- App password, not account password
- 2FA must be enabled
- "Less secure app access" NOT needed with app passwords
- Check Gmail security settings

### Calendar Events Not Creating

**Check:**
- Microsoft Graph config correct
- Admin consent granted
- Technician emails in same tenant
- Calendar permissions granted
- API not rate limited

### Mobile View Issues

**Check:**
- Routes optimized first
