## 🎯 Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Apply Database Schema (CRITICAL)
**Why:** Authentication won't work without the database tables

**Steps:**
1. Log into Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy contents of `docs/saas_database_schema.sql`
4. Execute the SQL
5. Verify tables were created:
   - organizations
   - profiles
   - organization_members
   - invitations
   - usage_tracking
   - subscriptions
   - invoices
   - plan_limits
   - events
6. Test RLS policies are enabled
7. Test trigger creates org on signup

### 2. Test Authentication Flow
**Why:** Verify everything works end-to-end

**Test Cases:**
1. ✅ Visit main.py - Should see landing page with signup CTA
2. ✅ Click "Sign Up" - Should go to registration page
3. ✅ Fill registration form and submit
4. ✅ Check email for verification link
5. ✅ Click verification link
6. ✅ Return to login page
7. ✅ Login with credentials
8. ✅ Should be redirected to operations page
9. ✅ Check organization was auto-created
10. ✅ Check user was assigned "owner" role
11. ✅ Visit settings page - Should see organization info
12. ✅ Try to access admin panel - Should have access (owner)
13. ✅ Logout - Should clear session
14. ✅ Try to access operations - Should redirect to login

### 3. Set Up Stripe Account
**Why:** Enable payment processing for subscriptions

**Steps:**
1. Go to stripe.com and create account
2. Complete business verification
3. Get API keys (test mode first)
4. Create products in Stripe dashboard:
   - Starter: $49/month recurring
   - Professional: $149/month recurring
   - Enterprise: Custom
5. Save API keys to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
6. Begin implementing Stripe integration

### 4. Commit Latest Changes
**Why:** Save progress to version control

**Steps:**
```bash
cd D:\streamlit_route_mvp
git add pages/settings.py IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
git commit -m "Add organization settings page and implementation status doc"
git push
```

## 🚦 Risk Assessment

### High Risk ✅ Mitigated
- ~~Multi-tenant data leakage~~ → Row Level Security implemented
- ~~Authentication vulnerabilities~~ → Using Supabase Auth (industry standard)
- ~~Session management issues~~ → Streamlit session state + JWT tokens

### Medium Risk ⚠️ Monitoring
- **Stripe integration complexity**
  - Mitigation: Use Stripe's pre-built Checkout and Portal
  - Fallback: Hire Stripe integration specialist
- **Usage tracking accuracy**
  - Mitigation: Database triggers for automatic counting
  - Fallback: Batch reconciliation jobs
- **Email deliverability**
  - Mitigation: Use SendGrid or AWS SES
  - Fallback: Multiple email providers

### Low Risk ✅ Under Control
- Scalability (Supabase scales automatically)
- Security (SOC 2 compliant via Supabase)
- Performance (OR-Tools optimizes in <30 seconds)

---

## 🎓 Technical Debt

### Code Quality
- ✅ Auth system well-documented
- ✅ Consistent error handling
- ⚠️ Need to add unit tests for auth functions
- ⚠️ Need to add integration tests for auth flow

### Documentation
- ✅ Product roadmap complete
- ✅ User stories documented
- ✅ Database schema documented
- ✅ Implementation status tracked (this file)
- ⚠️ Need API documentation (when API built)
- ⚠️ Need deployment guide for production

### Infrastructure
- ⚠️ Currently deployed on Streamlit Cloud (good for MVP)
- ⚠️ Will need to migrate to AWS/GCP for production scale
- ⚠️ Need CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- ⚠️ Need staging environment separate from production
