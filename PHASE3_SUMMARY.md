## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
Dispatch Page → Email System → SMTP Server → Technician Inbox
              → Graph API → Microsoft 365 → Outlook Calendar

Technician Page → Session State → Check-ins/Completions
                → Folium Maps → Interactive Map View
```

### Authentication Methods

**Email (SMTP):**
- Username/password auth
- App passwords for Gmail
- STARTTLS encryption
- Configurable via secrets or env vars

**Microsoft Graph:**

```
Optimized Routes → HTML Template → Email Content
                → ICS Generator → Calendar File
                → SMTP Client → Send Email
```

**Calendar Dispatch:**
```
Optimized Routes → Graph API Auth → Access Token
                → Event Builder → Event JSON
                → POST Request → Create Events
```

**Technician Tracking:**
```
Load Route → Session State → User Actions
